## LL parsers cannot be left-recursive aka LL parseres need right-recursion
## When we enter into a  set of brackets ()  {( = l,  ) = r} we 'reset' the presidence tracking and return to the top (A)
##		This happens at the bottom of the tree to avoid overlap
## Had to refactor some of the rules so that LL(1) will be able to have disjoint predict sets
## Not sure what presidence "0-9" should have, so I made it higher than (a)lternation and (seq)uence, equal to kleen and plus (* +)
